- To insert icon in editor, type in `:`/`ï¼šï¼š` followed by the search query to get suggester, for example `:book`
  - for multiple keywords, add `+` between words, for example `:open+book`
  - You can disable suggester in the setting tab
- The emoji, by default, is inserted in character in favor of shortcodes, which is visible in both editor and preview, you can change this behavior in the setting tab
